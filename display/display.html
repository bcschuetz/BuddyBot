            I want to help you connect with your colleagues and form friendships.
            That's why I'm showing you whose birthday it is today, which fun events you and your colleagues have planned in the near future, and fun facts about everyone who wants to share.  
  
            Go to the next or previous slide by pressing the right or left arrow keys, and stop or start the cycle of slides by pressing space.  
  
            If you want to create your Buddy Profile, change the information you entered or add an event, go to [CONFIG WEBSITE].  
            Have fun!
